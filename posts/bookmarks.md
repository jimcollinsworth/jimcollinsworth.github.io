This project analyzes the exported bookmarks from Chrome and allows the user to perform various filtering and vizualization tasks.

## Todo
 - Write python util to parse bookmarks, load into a dataframe for analysis. Maybe colab to start
 - Create privacy focused bookmark report/export for others (prob needs manual review)
 - Update blogroll page with results
 - Publish utility for others to use.
