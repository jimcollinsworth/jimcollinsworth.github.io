**M.E.**

M.E is a completely local, offline AI that you carry around, a small button, eyeglasses, anything. It has watched and listened from your \*perspective\* for years, it knows what you have done and knows you. All this contextual knowledge allows very efficient and reliable communication and control. A simple nod, gesture, uh-huh, location context, social cues, all understood. M.E. communicates back the same, simple haptic, audio, visual, REST API call, anything is possible. Make it unique to the hardware and individual, M.E. is for them.

M.E. doesn't record conversations, it learns and remembers essentially the way you do. If you keep repeating something, M.E. learns it to the word, but otherwise it's just merged in with all the other memories. But it works by training/versioning an LLM on the device.

Would playing back memories alter them? Seems it could if there is a training feedback loop, or we stop the training then. Maybe this is a grey line, between re-writing or wiring in. Where does 'versioning' fit in with LLMs, we need backup of course, but having the multiple versions could provide some additional functional purpose.

How to record everything I see/hear? The AI 'Pins' are a good idea, but maybe just a clip on camera/mic, transmits to smartphone for processing. An office headset, with an additional camera could work for separating work/personal if wanted, just put it on when you are working and want to record.

What does M.E. mean? not sure, but these were some good ones from chatai:

- **Mental Entity** – Emphasizing its nature as a cognitive, intelligent assistant
- **My Essence** – Reflecting a deeply personal connection, it learns and adapts based on the individual's experiences
- **Mental Engine** – Reflecting its role as the processing engine behind an intelligent, context-aware system
- **Mind Echo** – Highlighting its ability to echo or reflect the user's thoughts and actions
- **Mini Ego** – Playing on the idea of a personal, miniature version of your ego or self
- **Meta Entity** – Suggesting a being that transcends traditional boundaries, reflecting a higher-level connection with the user
- **Mystic Eye** – Suggesting an almost magical awareness of everything going on around the user
- **My Ears** – A playful, more casual name that indicates it's always listening to your needs
- **Memory Engine** – Focused on the idea of the AI being a memory-driven system that learns and adapts
- **Mind Evolved** – Suggesting that it is a highly advanced, evolving system, far beyond simple interaction
