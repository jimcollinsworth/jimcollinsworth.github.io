I'm newly retired this year after 50 years of working with software and clients. 20 years at Arthur Andersen, then as a guitarist, back to software and a couple startups and finally finishing up with a data science job after the pandemic. Now I get to sit back (hopefully) and enjoy the family, continue learning, exercising, the Chicago lakefront, AI and the next few decades of amazing change and innovation. 

"how does that work" is the question that is always in my mind, and comes up for everything; software, hardware, electricity, biology, society, law, music, art, psychology.... I'll be the first to admit something I don't know, but at the same time will be flushing out the alternatives, questioning everything, devising an educated guess and following up as soon as I can to understand.
