There aren't many blogs or other information sources that I consistently read, it's more activity driven, what project and framework I'm working on, topic of interest or just random. There is simply too much content available and my interests and attention waver to much to settle in somewhere. That said, [techdirt.com](https://techdirt.com) has been probably my most consistent blog read for maybe 15 years. I like the industry and law coverage they provide as well as 'This week in history' looking back 5, 10 and 15 years at tech innovations and issues.

So instead of just a blogroll I'll try to share a more expansive list of what I use from the internet. The plan is to start with my [bookmarks data](/pursuits/bookmarks), add some vizualization and filtering and report the results. Hoping it will be very useful for my own use too.
